# SEALPIR

This folder currently implements a classic pir algorithm, providing a solid foundation for further developments.

## Future Enhancements

We plan to expand this by introducing additional algorithms based on the current one. Our roadmap includes:

Keyword PIR to Index PIR Conversion: We aim to support seamless conversion between Keyword PIR and Index PIR,
enhancing the flexibility and applicability of the solution.

Algorithm Utilization: Future updates will leverage these new algorithms to optimize and broaden the project's capabilities.

## Stay Tuned

We are excited about these upcoming enhancements and encourage you to watch this repository for future updates.
Your interest and support are greatly appreciated as we continue to innovate and expand our project.
